\section{Defining the Strategy}
    Answer two basic question:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What do we want to get from this product?
        \item What do our user want from this product?
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Product Objectives}
    Is it a service or product? Usually we do not clear our objectives in case of product and thus different people will have different ideas.
\subsection{Business Goals}
    Sometimes you say, ‘To earn money’ or ‘To Save money’. These are too general. On the other hand, very specific, such as ‘To provide text messaging service for users’, which does not explain the requirement of you. We tell the conditions for success, not path.
\subsection{Brand Identity}
    Your brand is neither only a logo nor typography. It can be represented by users’ interaction with your website. This experience would be your brand.
